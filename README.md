## How to use this Repo

The `master` branch has a starter template for creating what is in the `final` branch.

There is an Angular app included, but is entirely optional.  Since JWT authentication is commonly seen in SPAs (single page applications) like Angular, I decided it was important to at least have a basic implementation.

## How to run the app

When you go to each branch, the `README.md` will show you how to start the app.
